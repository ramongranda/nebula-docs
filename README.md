## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Responsive Design**: Includes a `boilerplate.css` for responsive utilities.
- **Markdown Documentation**: All content is authored in Markdown under `src/pages/docs/`.
- **JSON Generation**: Automatically generates JSON before running the development server.
- **Custom Hooks and Scripts**: Utility scripts for navigation, themes, and table of contents.

## ðŸ“š Documentation Guidelines

- All documentation must be written in English.
- Use Markdown with proper frontmatter for each page:
  ```markdown
  ---
  layout: ../../layouts/DocLayout.astro
  title: Page Title
  description: One-line summary.
  ---
  ```
- Start sections at `##` (no `#` as the layout renders the title).
- Use fenced code blocks with language tags (e.g., ` ```ts `, ` ```bash `).
